# validator-plugin-vsphere
The vSphere [validator](https://github.com/spectrocloud-labs/validator) plugin ensures that your vSphere environment matches a user-configurable expected state.

## Description
The vSphere validator plugin reconciles `VsphereValidator` custom resources to perform the following validations against your vSphere environment:

1. Compare the privileges associated with a user against an expected privileges set
2. Compare the privileges associated with a user against an expected privileges set on a particular entity(cluster, resourcepool, folder, vapp, host)
3. Check if enough compute resources are available on a host, resourcepool or cluster against a resource request
4. Compare the tags associated with a datacenter, cluster, host, vm, resourcepool or vm against an expected tag set
5. Check if a given set of host systems have a valid NTP configuration

Each `VsphereValidator` CR is (re)-processed every two minutes to continuously ensure that your vSphere environment matches the expected state.

See the [samples](https://github.com/spectrocloud-labs/validator-plugin-vsphere/tree/main/config/samples) directory for example `VsphereValidator` configurations.

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin currently require a user with administrator role to perform all of the validations specified above. Further information on fine-grained permissions required by each validation will be updated in the future.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/validator-plugin-vsphere:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/validator-plugin-vsphere:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
